# hey, I’m Harleen 👋

🎓 BTech CSE (Cyber Security) @ VIT Chennai  
🔐 breaking systems so I can secure them  
🤖 AI/ML + 🌐 full stack  
🚀 co-founder & CTO @ CarbonCTRL  

I’m a second year CS student who likes building things that actually work in the real world.  
I spend my time playing CTFs, training ML models, and turning random ideas into shipped products.  
If it involves security, AI, or systems, I’m probably into it.
